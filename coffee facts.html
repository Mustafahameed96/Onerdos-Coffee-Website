<p> <font  color="white"> Have you noticed coffee is no longer just a drink…it’s a lifestyle. People take coffee breaks, meet for coffee, do business over coffee, have coffee on the go and even have coffee mornings! It’s a trend storming the world over which is fuelling both a fresh appreciation for true quality coffee and a new breed of coffee houses, where the experience of meeting, recharging or just watching the world go by is equally as important as the steaming cup of liquid perfection served.<br> 
With life getting busier and time becoming a precious commodity, coffee culture has exploded as more and more people gravitate towards coffee houses where they can conveniently refresh, relax and regroup during the day. 
Coffee houses are not a new concept by any means; in fact the first coffee houses were believed to appear as far back as the 15th century in the Middle East. And then, like now, they weren’t just about drinking coffee but about an experience of social interaction and relaxation. <br>

The word 'cappuccino' is the result of several derivations, the original of which began in 16th century. The Capuchin order of friars, established after 1525, played an important role in bringing Catholicism back to Reformation Europe. Its Italian name came from the long, pointed cowl, or cappuccino, derived from cappuccio, "hood," that was worn as part of the order's habit. The French version of cappuccino was capuchin, from which came English Capuchin. In Italian, cappuccino went on to describe espresso coffee mixed or topped with steamed milk or cream, so called because the color of the coffee resembled the color of the habit of a Capuchin friar. The first use of cappuccino in English is recorded in 1948 in a work about San Francisco <br>

Coffee beans are graded in various ways. For example: Kenyan coffees are graded as A, B and C. Grade AA is the best coffee. In Costa Rica, coffees are graded as Strictly Hard Bean, Good Hard Bean, Hard Bean, Medium Hard Bean, High Grown Atlantic, Medium Grown Atlantic, and Low Grown Atlantic. Whereas coffee beans from Colombia are labeled as "Supremo" "Excelso", "Extra" and the lowest grade, "Pasilla".  <br>

Coffee’s most exacting rite of passage is known as "cupping" or cup tasting. It is the act of assessing the qualities of a particular batch of beans by freshly roasting, brewing, and tasting it. It is the work for serious and talented professionals.  <br>

Crema is a golden-browish foam that covers a freshly brewed cup of espresso. It is only made by a high-pressured method of extraction. An even thicker layer of crema also helps keep the heat and aroma of espresso.  <br>

The original Cappuccino machines were true works of art in the inimitable Italian style. Massive, ornate, and impressive steam machines were designed to brew coffee and foam milk in a stimulating and entertaining ritual. Much of the enjoyment of this exotic Italian classic was watching the server make it in the elegant Cappuccino machine, with skill and showmanship. <br>

The inventors of Cappuccino decided that it's preparation should be as dramatic as it's distinguished taste and appearance. So they designed an appropriately impressive Cappuccino machine. <br>
